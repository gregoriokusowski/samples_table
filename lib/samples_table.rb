# samples_table is a gem that helps the writing of spec cases.
# Based on cucumber's tables, it can be used without dependencies.
#
# How to configure(with RSpec):
# # spec_helper.rb
# RSpec.configure do |config|
#   #your old config here
#   config.extend SamplesTable, :type => :model
# end
# 
# How to use:
# require 'spec_helper'
# describe Sale do
#   describe "selling fruits" do
#     (samples [ :fruit , :quantity , :total ],
#              [ :apple ,     1     ,   1.0  ],
#              [ :apple ,     2     ,   2.0  ],
#              [ :apple ,    10     ,   9.5  ],#should apply discount when sells 10+
#              [ :orange,     1     ,   2.0  ],
#              [ :orange,     2     ,   4.0  ],
#              [ :orange,    10     ,  19.0  ]).each_sample do |sample|
#       describe "when selling #{sample.fruit}" do
#         before{subject.fruit = sample.fruit}
#         describe "and the customer wants to buy #{sample.quantity}" do
#           before{subject.quantity = sample.quantity}
#           it "should totalize #{sample.total} bucks" do
#             subject.total.should eql sample.total
